Patterns in Data Science
========================

This is a collection of code excerpts, mostly in R, to address common puzzles in data sciences. They are organized by different bodies of knowledge and should serve as something similar to a cheat sheet. I am still in the process of gathering them from a number of different projects and course notes done in the past, so more content to be added and what is already in here might get further organized (time allowing).

Most of this content is not original, and is either copied from my own other projects and the absolute majority from lectures of the [Data Science Specialization at Johns Hopkins](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics).

Note: github has size limitations on serving HTML content, and most of this material is rendered as an HTML output from R chunks. If you have problems visualizing the content, click on the **[MD]** or **[RMD]** for the markup document.

---------------------

Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses.

[Regression Models](https://cdn.rawgit.com/jfaleiro/datasciencepatterns/master/RegressionModels/index.html) -- [MD](RegressionModels/index.md) [RMD](RegressionModels/index.Rmd)
-----------------

Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in data sciences. These notes cover regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models.

Machine Learning

Annotations on tools and techniques for understanding, building, and testing prediction functions. Common tasks performed by data scientists and data analysts in prediction and machine learning. Basic grounding concepts related to selection of training and tests sets, overfitting, and error rates. A wide range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests.
