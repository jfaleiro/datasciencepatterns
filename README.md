Patterns in Data Science
========================

This is a collection of code excerpts, mostly in R, to address common questions in data sciences. They are organized by different bodies of knowledge and should serve as a cheat sheet. I am still in the process of gathering them from a number of different projects and course notes, so more content to be added and what is already in here might get further organized (time allowing).

Most of this content is not original, and is either copied from my own other projects and the absolute majority from lectures of the [Data Science Specialization at Johns Hopkins](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics).

[Statistical Inference](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jfaleiro/datasciencepatterns/blob/master/StatisticalInference/index.html) -- [MD](StatisticalInference/index.md)
---------------------

Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses.

[Regression Models](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jfaleiro/datasciencepatterns/blob/master/RegressionModels/index.html) -- [MD](RegressionModels/index.md)
-----------------

Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in data sciences. These notes cover regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models.
